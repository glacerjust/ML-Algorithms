# Linear Regression Project

This project implements a **Linear Regression algorithm** from scratch in Python. It demonstrates the basics of gradient descent and feature scaling on the **California Housing dataset**.

---

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is located in the `data/` folder. It is used to train and evaluate the Linear Regression model implemented in `linear_regression.py`.

### Dataset Description

- **Source**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices  
- **Format**: CSV  
- **Columns**: "longitude","latitude","housing_median_age","total_rooms","total_bedrooms","population","households","median_income","median_house_value","ocean_proximity"  
- **Size**: depends on Kaggle version (usually ~20,000 rows)

### Usage

To run the Linear Regression algorithm:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/glacerjust/hello-github.git
# 2. Navigate to the LinearRegression directory:
cd ML-Algorithms/LinearRegression
# 3. Run the script:
python linear_regression.py
